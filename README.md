# Apple Vision Pro Clone

Welcome to the Apple Vision Pro Clone project! This project aims to replicate some functionalities of Apple's Vision Pro tool.

## Description

Apple Vision Pro is a cutting-edge software that offers advanced image recognition and analysis capabilities. This project attempts to emulate some of its features, providing a simplified version of image recognition using machine learning.

## Features

- **Image Recognition:** Upload images and receive predictions about objects detected in the image.
- **Classification:** Classify images into predefined categories.
- **API Integration:** Easy-to-use API for developers to integrate this functionality into their applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Flask (for the backend)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the frontend)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Apple-Vision-Pro-Clone.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Start the server: `python app.py`
2. Access the application through a web browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## API Endpoints

- `/predict`: Endpoint for image prediction.
- `/classify`: Endpoint for image classification.
